# Movie-Recommendation-System-Project
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System Project, a data science and machine learning application designed to suggest movies based on user preferences. This project uses content-based filtering techniques along with natural language processing (NLP) methods to provide intelligent movie recommendations. Built using Python, it is an ideal demonstration of data preprocessing, vectorization (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer), similarity metrics, and basic UI integration using streamlit.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System. It suggests similar movies based on various attributes such as genres, overview, cast, crew, and keywords. The model uses cosine similarity to find movies that are most alike the user's selected movie.

Key components of the system include:

Data collection and preprocessing

Feature engineering and combining relevant metadata

Vectorization using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF

Computing similarity using cosine similarity

A simple and intuitive user interface using Streamlit

🧠 Features Implemented
✅ Movie Metadata Parsing (Genres, Keywords, Cast, Crew)

✅ Content-Based Filtering with NLP techniques

✅ Cosine Similarity to find similar movies

✅ Efficient preprocessing using pandas and numpy

✅ Integration with TMDb dataset

✅ Real-time movie suggestion with user input

✅ Streamlit-based frontend for interaction

🗂️ Dataset Used
The project uses publicly available datasets from The Movie Database (TMDb), consisting of:

movies.csv: Basic information about movies (title, genre, overview)

credits.csv: Details of cast and crew

keywords.csv: Keywords associated with each movie

These datasets are merged and transformed for analysis and recommendation.

📊 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy – For data handling and manipulation

Scikit-learn – For CountVectorizer and similarity computation

NLTK – (Optional) For text preprocessing

Streamlit – For building the interactive frontend

Jupyter Notebook – For development and analysis

🔎 How It Works
Data Merging: Merge movies, credits, and keywords datasets into a unified DataFrame.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant metadata such as genres, cast, director, and keywords.

Tag Creation: Combine all textual metadata into a single column called tags.

Text Vectorization: Use CountVectorizer to convert text into vectors (Bag-of-Words).

Similarity Matrix: Compute cosine similarity between all movie vectors.

Recommendation: Return top N similar movies when a user selects one.

🖥️ How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-System
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
🧪 Example
When a user types the movie name "Interstellar", the system returns a list of similar movies like:

Inception

The Martian

Gravity

Arrival

2001: A Space Odyssey

🚀 Future Improvements
Incorporate collaborative filtering or hybrid models

Add movie posters and trailers

Integrate user login to track preferences

Deploy using Streamlit Cloud or Heroku
